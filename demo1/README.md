Template for a Google AppEngine REST Application
=

Relying on GAE-friendly versions of:

* Jersey (1.18.1)
* Jackson (1.9.2)
* Guice (3.0)

Available online at: <http://gae-jersey-guice.appspot.com> 

Even though there are newer generations for these products (Jersey 2.x and Jackson 2.x), Google AppEngine still works with Servlet specifications version 2.5, and doesn't play well with those advanced generations (that were built to cater for Servlet 3.0 specifications).

This template project provides all the required configuration (`web.xml`, Jersey, Jackson, Guice) so that all features from all products work smoothly together. It also provides the code for two typical requirements (easily removable if unneeded):

* CORS filter - to add CORS headers that are mandatory in public REST APIs
* `@PostConstruct` annotation for injectable beans. This allows you the initialize your classes outside the constructor (which is invoked before the dependencies are injected)

The code demonstrates two types of APIs (implemented as JAX-RS annotated classes): 

* `TestAPI` - Demonstrates how to return a Java bean (`MyBean`) as either JSON or XML (this is a `@Singleton` resource)
* `InfoAPI` - Returns an HTML page with the environmental settings, including those of the `HttpRequest` (hence it is `@RequestScoped`)

The code also demonstrates how to bind and inject an implementation class (`MyImpl`) into an interface placeholder (`MyIntf`).

All Jersey and Guice configuration parameters are set in the class `RestConfig`. Jackson's JSON configuration parameters are set in `JsonProvider`.

To build:

	mvn clean package
	
To execute locally (on <http://localhost:8080>):

	mvn appengine:devserver

To deploy to GAE:

	mvn appengine:update
